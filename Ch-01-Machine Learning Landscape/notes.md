Chapter 1 — The Machine Learning Landscape (Human-Friendly Notes)
1- What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is when a computer learns from data instead of being given rules by a programmer.
We do not give the computer rules.
We give it data, and it finds the pattern.

Example:
Show the computer many photos of cats → it learns what a cat looks like.

2- Why do we use Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is useful because:

Some problems are too hard to explain step-by-step
(like understanding speech or recognizing images)
ML can handle huge amounts of data that humans can’t process
ML can adapt and change with new data
ML discovers patterns we might not notice
3- Types of Machine Learning (in simple words)
✅ Supervised Learning
Data has answers (labels)
Model learns from examples + the correct output
Example:
Predicting house prices / spam detection

✅ Unsupervised Learning
Data has no answers
Model tries to discover patterns on its own
Example:
Grouping customers with similar behavior

✅ Semi-supervised Learning
A mix: a little labeled data + a lot of unlabeled data.

✅ Reinforcement Learning
The model learns by trial and error
It takes actions → gets rewards or penalties
Tries to learn the best strategy over time
Example:
A robot learning to walk or a game-playing AI.
